# Design system sources

This document defines which Figma files are the source of truth for the 2026 Sip Design System.

## Components

**File:** [2026 - SIP Design System](https://www.figma.com/design/OhvdRjc8MDdIYteTWMIU2k/2026---SIP-Design-System)

- **Purpose:** Single source of truth for all UI components (e.g. Button, and any future components).
- **Use when:** Building components, checking specs, or asking “is this our button/component?”
- **File key (for tools):** `OhvdRjc8MDdIYteTWMIU2k`

## Foundations / tokens

**File:** [2026 - SIP_DS_Foundations](https://www.figma.com/design/5abNQShIsPh4oFUoOHSQte/2026---SIP_DS_Foundations)

- **Purpose:** Source for design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, grid, elevation) and foundation documentation.
- **Use when:** Working with tokens, `tokens/*.json`, `tokens/design-tokens.css`, or docs like `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` and `documentation/GRID_SYSTEM_FEEDBACK.md`.
- **File key (for tools):** `5abNQShIsPh4oFUoOHSQte`

When in doubt: **components** → SIP Design System file; **tokens/foundations** → SIP_DS_Foundations file.
